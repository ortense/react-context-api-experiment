# React Context API experiment

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), as a clone of [ortense/react-redux-experiment](https://github.com/ortense/react-redux-experiment) to compare Redux and Context in a simples use case.

## Folder Structure

After creation, your project should look like this:

```
my-app/
  README.md
  node_modules/
  package.json
  public/
    index.html
    favicon.ico
  src/
    components/
    store/
    App.css
    App.js
    App.test.js
    index.css
    index.js
    logo.svg
```

For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

* `public/index.html` is the page template;
* `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.
* `src/components` is the steteless components
* `src/store` is the store created with *context api*

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
